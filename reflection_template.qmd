[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an \_\_.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv
#This originated from Lab 2 Challenge, the very first load in. I removed library(viridis) becuase that is not relevant here.
library(tidyverse)
library("here")
surveys <- read_csv(here::here("data","surveys.csv"))
```

-   `xlsx`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx
#This code originates from the practice activity 4 - Military spending. Here, not only do we load in a xlsx file, we also specify the sheet and rows we wanted to include. 
military <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending", 
                      skip  = 7, 
                      n_max = 190)
```

-   `txt`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-txt
#This code originates from Check-in 2.3. 
ages_tab <-Â read_table(file = here::here("Week 2", "Check-ins", "Ages_Data", "ages_tab.txt"))
```

**WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.**

```{r}
#| label: wd-2
#This originated from Lab 4 Q4. Here I select only region, study_year, and mhi_2018 to remain within the dataset)
ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c("2018", 
                           "2008")) |>
  select(region, 
         study_year, 
         mhi_2018) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarise(median_region = median(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = region,
             names_from = study_year, 
             values_from = median_region,
             names_prefix = "mhi_in_")|>
  ungroup()

```

**WD-3: I can filter rows from a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-numeric
#This originated from Lab 4 Q4. Here I filter out year 2008 and 2018.
ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c("2018", 
                           "2008")) |>
  select(region, 
         study_year, 
         mhi_2018) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarise(median_region = median(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = region,
             names_from = study_year, 
             values_from = median_region,
             names_prefix = "mhi_in_")|>
  ungroup()
```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**)

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-string
#This question originates from Lab 5. In this particular chunk, I filter using str_detect so I could extract all Annabels regardless of 
person |>
  filter(
    address_street_name == "Franklin Ave",
    str_detect(name, "Annabel")) |>
  pull(name,
       id)
```

-   factor

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-factor

```

-   date (example must use functions from **lubridate**)

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-date
#This code comes from Lab 5. Originally, I did not convert the dates into lubridate dates. However, 
crime_scene_report |>
  filter(date == 20180115,
         type == "murder",
         city == "SQL City") |>
  pull(description)

#Here is the updated code USING lubridate instead of filtering it just as a numeric value
crime_scene_report |>
  mutate(date = ymd(date)
         )|>
  filter(date == "2018-01-15",
         type == "murder",
         city == "SQL City") |>
  pull(description)
```

**WD-4: I can modify existing variables and create new variables in a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric (using `as.numeric()` is not sufficient)

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-numeric
#This originates from the set up in Lab 3 Challenge. Here, I am creating a cleaner version of the dataset's question_no variable by subtracting 900 (effectively converting each question number into the a number 1-9 isntead of 901-909).
clean_evals <- evals |>
  mutate(sex = gender,
         teacher_id = as.factor(teacher_id),
         question_no = question_no-900)
```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**)

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-string
#This originates from Lab 4 Question3. Here I modify the existing county name and create a new variable with the same name that removes " Count" from all values within. 
ca_childcare <- ca_childcare |> 
  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, 
                                  " County"))
```

-   factor (example must use functions from **forcats**)

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-factor
#The question is from Lab 4 Q6. In this code chunk, I am changing age into a factor that includes all three age groups. Afterwards, I recode it and change the names.
ca_childcare |>
  select(region, 
         study_year, 
         mc_infant,
         mc_toddler,
         mc_preschool) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = mc_infant:mc_preschool,
               names_to = "age",
               values_to = "price") |>
  mutate(age = fct(age,
                   levels = c("mc_infant",
                              "mc_toddler",
                              "mc_preschool")),
         age = fct_recode(.f = age,
                    "Infant" = "mc_infant",
                    "Toddler" = "mc_toddler",
                    "Preschool" = "mc_preschool"))
```

-   date (example must use functions from **lubridate**)

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-date
#As mentioned in WD-3, this line of code comes from Lab 5 and is altered from my original submission to include a date mutation with lubridate using ymd()
crime_scene_report |>
  mutate(date = ymd(date)
         )|>
  filter(date == "2018-01-15",
         type == "murder",
         city == "SQL City") |>
  pull(description)
```

**WD-5: I can use mutating joins to combine multiple dataframes.**

-   `left_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-5-left
#This code is from Lab 4 question 2. Here I implement a left_join()

ca_childcare <- counties |>
  filter(state_abbreviation == "CA") |>
  left_join(childcare_costs,
            by = join_by(county_fips_code == county_fips_code))
```

-   `right_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-5-right

```

-   `inner_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-5-inner
#Here i include code from Lab 5 and combine three different dataframes. I also use robust & resitant coding by confirming that ssn == ssn just in case. 
inner_join(person,
           drivers_license,
           join_by(license_id == id)) |>
  inner_join(facebook_event_checkin,
           join_by(id == person_id)) |>
  inner_join(income, join_by(ssn == ssn))
```

-   `full_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-5-full

```

**WD-6: I can use filtering joins to filter rows from a dataframe.**

-   `semi_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-6-semi

```

-   `anti_join()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-6-anti

```

**WD-7: I can pivot dataframes from long to wide and visa versa**

-   `pivot_longer()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-7-long
#This code originates from a small portion of Lab 4's Question 6. Here I take the three separate age colomns and combine them into a single colomn.
ca_childcare |>
  select(region, 
         study_year, 
         mc_infant,
         mc_toddler,
         mc_preschool) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = mc_infant:mc_preschool,
               names_to = "age",
               values_to = "price")
```

-   `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
#| label: wd-7-wide
#This is from Lab 4 question 4. Here, I make two new colomns out of the two years from study_year.
ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c("2018", 
                           "2008")) |>
  select(region, 
         study_year, 
         mhi_2018) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarise(median_region = median(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = region,
             names_from = study_year, 
             values_from = median_region,
             names_prefix = "mhi_in_")|>
  ungroup()
```

Instead of selecting a certain row, i request that the minimum value is extracted, ensuring that regardless of how shuffled the dataset is, i get the exact value i want.

#This code originates from Lab 4 Question 7. I will admit, I did not follow the question completely: I extended past what was asked for and included regional data when i wasn't supposed to. I would like to argue that this shows my creativity. I was originally just playing around with the graph and wanted to explore some trends. I was curious how region played into this correlation and was interested in the results of this inclusion (for examoke, all San Fransisco values are very high, Central Coast are right in the middle, etc.). For this reason, adding color just as an extra layer to graph demonstrates that I am thinking about what researchers would want to present and creative ways to include notible finds.

```

-   Function that operates on data frames

```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-1
#This is code from Lab 4. Here, i use pivot_wider() and names_prefix() in conjunction, which is a relatively modern approach to what I wanted to do. Instead of using separate functions to pivot and rename the variable, i was able to do it all in one place.
